## React Portfolio

# In-progress portfolio website created from scratch in React

**View what the website currently looks like here! https://bchh325.github.io/portfolio-v2/**

The funny thing is that the writing-style here feels a lot less "professional" <br>
here compared to my application over at: https://github.com/bchh325/trading-site <br>
The point of this is to show more of my personality.. _hopefully_

I always enjoy looking back and seeing just how projects start and how far they have come.

If you are like me, here's a quick image of what the site looked like when I first started!

This is from the commit titled "**created barebones template using flexbox**"

## Here are some tasks I have planned!
* Having a modal appear when a project is clicked that displays some information and the link to the site and repository
* Adding functionality to the nav buttons that make it scroll to a certain point in the page
* Fix text getting cut off on some browsers on mobile devices (Safari iOS is the main culprit. Chrome iOS works fine)
* Add the rest of my projects
* Add profile picture
* Fix styling on Android devices
